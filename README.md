- Weapon-specific timing windows
- Player movement velocity
- Distance calculations

#### Auto Parry Configuration

Users can fine-tune auto parry behavior through multiple parameters:

**Timing Sensitivity:**
- Conservative: Parries slightly early for maximum success rate
- Balanced: Optimal timing for most situations
- Aggressive: Latest possible parry for counter-attack advantage

**Range Settings:**
- Maximum parry distance
- Minimum activation range
- Auto-adjust for lag compensation

**Weapon Compatibility:**
- Per-weapon timing profiles
- Custom timing overrides
- Weapon switching detection
